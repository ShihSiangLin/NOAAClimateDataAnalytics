# Example assignments for students to utilize climate risk data to perform analysis and extract insights.

These materials provide sample guidance and demonstrations for instructors to design an assignment for students to be exposed to climate risk data. It all depends on the instructor’s intention of what they want the students to practice and learn.
With the collective effort of the HTF Cloud Fellowship Program, we hope to plant the seeds of using climate intelligence as we build out the growing business of climate analytics — the data, risk models, tailored analyses, and insights that people and institutions need to understand and respond to climate risk and change.

### Instructions for using this package:

1. Open the “How to access data on AWS.docx” document and follow the instructions. The document shows how to obtain and access data in the cloud. For reference, the data has already been downloaded into the “Climate Risk Data” folder included with the example notebooks if accessing data in the cloud is not a learning requirement.
2. Open “Flood-Risk-Analysis.ipynb” in the Jupyter Notebooks folder as the first example. This notebook demonstrates the process of analyzing climate risk data using a local data source.
3. The second example is “Heat-Risk-Analysis.ipynb” in the Jupyter Notebooks folder. It shows how to perform data analysis using data from the AWS S3 buckets as obtained by following the directions in the “How to access data on AWS.docx” document.
4. Finally, the “US vs WV_four risks_analysis.ipynb” notebook in the Jupyter Notebooks folder is the culmination of four different hazard risk analyses in West Virginia or the United States.
